# Calculator

# Goal
The main point of this project is to learn how to use Visual Studios in general as well as how to use it with Github. This is also a practice on my knowledge of the composite, strategy, and factory design patterns. I took some of the code I used in class projects and then created more to finish off this calculator.

# Patterns
- Composite Pattern - I plan to implement this pattern with how I do the basic operations of a scietific calculator.

- Strategy Pattern - I plan  to implement this with adding a number sorter that will have different list to put the numbers in as well as different sorting algorithms to sort them.

- Factory Pattern - I plan to implement this through giving the user an option to use the scientific calulator or number sorting part of the calculator so which parts the program will be run at runtime making it the factory pattern.

- Decorator Pattern - I added a few functions that would have worked better fallowing the decorator design pattern over the composite pattern which were the truncation which simplifies a portion of the problem, absolute value which findes the absolute of a problem, and parenthisis which puts parathisis around parts of a problem but doesn't really change the order of the problem.
